# the radar hmm inspired by pokemon

the hidden variable is a location in a 20 x 20 grid

the observation is a radar check at a location in a 20 x 20 grid as well

the radar returns TRUE if the hidden variable is within a certain distance from
the radar location, and FALSE if it lies outside

the goal is to find the hidden location with a set of radar observations
